          Close friends are truly life’s treasures. Sometimes they know us
          better than we know ourselves. With gentle honesty, they are there to
          guide and support us, to share our laughter and our tears. Their
          presence reminds us that we are never really alone.

          possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables. But
          they're really difficult, so instead I just stuck a tracer on the
          inside of the memory stick.
